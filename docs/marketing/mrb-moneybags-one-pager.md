Steward every dollar. Prove every outcome.

Mr. MoneyBags is a modern, audit‑ready fund accounting platform that gives boards, executives, and finance teams real‑time insight and stewardship over restricted and designated funds. Designed for multimillion‑dollar philanthropic foundations and large churches, it delivers GAAP/FASB 958 alignment, airtight donor restriction tracking, and board‑ready reporting—without the bloat or consulting overhead.

## Who We Serve
- Philanthropic Foundations: track grants, programs, and restricted gifts; report outcomes with confidence.
- Mega Churches: steward designated funds (building, missions, benevolence) transparently across campuses and ministries.

## Problems We Solve
- Donor restrictions and grant lifecycles are hard to enforce in legacy systems.
- Spreadsheet sprawl slows audits and board reporting.
- Limited visibility into fund health, burn rate, and program impact.

## The Mr. MoneyBags Solution
- True fund accounting: entity, GL, fund, and restriction dimensions built‑in.
- Real‑time dashboards: balances, burn rate, and budget vs. actual by fund/program.
- Audit‑ready journal flows: approvals, posting, and immutable audit trails.

## Outcomes
- 100% visibility into restricted/designated funds and compliance status.
- Faster board reporting (hours → minutes).
- Clean audits with traceable support down to each entry line.

## Product Highlights
- FASB 958 alignment; posted vs. unposted JE control.
- Granular role‑based permissions; multi‑entity support and consolidation.
- Bulk imports (accounts, vendors, payments), CSV templates, and validations.
- Powerful search and segmentation by entity, fund, and restriction.
- Export to Excel/CSV; scheduled reports; PDF board packets.

## Security & Compliance
- Least‑privilege roles and activity/audit logs.
- Encryption in transit; PostgreSQL backbone; backup and retention policies.
- Segregation of duties with approvals and posting gates.

## Implementation & Migration
- 2–6 weeks typical; white‑glove onboarding.
- Structured data migration from legacy systems/spreadsheets.
- Parallel‑run support and training for finance teams.

## Pricing & ROI
- Tiered by entities/users; predictable annual pricing.
- 3–6 month payback from audit savings, faster reporting, and reduced spreadsheet risk.
